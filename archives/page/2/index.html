I’d planned to make a full loop of the island, but I’m headed to Sri Lanka in a few weeks and wanted to spend some more time in Taipei before I leave, so I hopped a train when I got to the end of the tracks in the south and came back to Taipei. When I come back to Taiwan I’ll rent a bike again and go down the east coast, which’ll probably be sometime this summer.</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<p><img src="/images/taiwan_bike_blfxsl.jpg" alt="taiwan_bike">] One of the first temples we came across.</p>
<p>Before leaving on the trip I found it terribly hard to find any information online in English about biking around Taiwan, so here it is.</p>
<h3 id="Renting-a-Bike"><a href="#Renting-a-Bike" class="headerlink" title="Renting a Bike"></a>Renting a Bike</h3><p>Giant Bikes has a half famous but at the same time still half unknown bike rental program for long distance trips. It’s famous in the sense that everyone in Taiwan seems to know about it, but half unknown in the sense that nobody can tell you the details. I had someone who spoke Chinese call Giant for me and here’s the deal:</p>
<p>You rent a Giant bike from any of the company-owned (versus franchised) Giant outlets in Taiwan, preferably a week in advanced. The bikes will have little luggage bags on them and basically come with everything you’d ever need for your trip, and you can return them to any company owned Giant outlet. You’ll also be able to grab a coffee and wash up at any company-owned outlet you come across; this almost sold us on renting from Giant, but we ended up renting from an independent bike shop and any time we stopped in a Giant (or Merida) shop for directions, they were still super nice and occasionally offered us a coffee anyway.</p>
<p>I can’t remember the exact price for the Giant rental program because we ended up going with another option, which was much cheaper: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://bluepuffy1990.pixnet.net/blog/post/13754737">http://bluepuffy1990.pixnet.net/blog/post/13754737</a>. This is a small shop owned by an old man in Damsui. He only speaks Chinese, but if you can speak with him he’ll rent you the same bike as Giant would have with all the same gear at $2,000 for 15 days and $100/day after that (Taiwan dollars). He stocked us up with free bottles of water before we left, tore the tags off a brand new bike to rent to my friend, and I brought the bike back one day over the 15 days for which he refused to take my $100NT. Nice guy, we did a lot of research before we rented and that’s who you’d probably want to go with.</p>
<p>If you can’t rent from him and don’t want to rent from Giant, just take the MRT up to Damsui. When you get off you’ll be surrounded by bike shops and they’ll all be happy to rent to you, I don’t think you’d even need to call ahead.</p>
<p><img src="/images/taiwan_bike_2_j74hdg.jpg" alt="taiwan&lt;em&gt;bike&lt;/em&gt;2"> Red dirt overlooking Taichung city.</p>
<h3 id="Where-to-Sleep"><a href="#Where-to-Sleep" class="headerlink" title="Where to Sleep"></a>Where to Sleep</h3><p>If you’ve got a hotel budget of a few hundred US dollars for your trip, you can just sleep in hostels in the big cities and hotels in the small cities along the way. A hotel room in these small cities were between $1000-$1500 Taiwan dollars per night, and we never had an issue rolling into town and finding a room on the spot. Except in Douliu where a teenage ice skating competition of all things had rented out almost all the rooms…but even there we found one for a few hundred Taiwan Dollars more than normal.</p>
<p>This is also Taiwan, where everyone helps everyone else, so amazingly enough if you want to sleep for free the whole way that’s cool too. Head to any temple and ask to speak with the priest, and ask his/her permission to sleep in their rest room. These are rooms for travellers who don’t have anywhere to stay, not every temple has them but enough of them do that after 2-3 temples you should find one. We didn’t end up staying in one, but we were told repeatedly that they’d be more than happy to have us. On the east coast we were told that police stations also have rest rooms, and that they might be fine with having you sleep there as well. Lastly, just sleep outside in a sleeping bag – nobody will mind.</p>
<h3 id="What-Route-to-Take"><a href="#What-Route-to-Take" class="headerlink" title="What Route to Take"></a>What Route to Take</h3><p>Honestly, still no idea. We Just figured it out as we went along, and no matter what road we took we always saw other bikers on the road (road biking is crazy popular in Taiwan). In general we found the small highways/small roads way better than the major highways, but for safety it’s worth noting that just about every road we were on had a bike lane and most of the major highways had bike trails carved out beside them, particularly where this meant avoiding a dangerous piece of the highway. Again, biking is popular.</p>
<h3 id="How-Long-Does-It-Take"><a href="#How-Long-Does-It-Take" class="headerlink" title="How Long Does It Take"></a>How Long Does It Take</h3><p>We heard someone in the giant tour tell us they take experienced bikers around the island in 9 days. Judging by the distances they said they covered every day (about 100km), this’d probably mean they stick to major highways so in my opinion I’d say you give it more time. To go to Kaoshiung from Taipei we made a point of going as slowly as possible, we’ve lived in Taiwan long enough to have friends in most of these cities, so we spent up to 5 days each hanging out in Taichong, Tainan, and Kaoshiung once we got there. It took us two weeks to go to Kaoshiung, but again that was intentionally slow, and if you didn’t spend a lot of time in each city two weeks would probably get you around the island comfortably, maybe 2.5 weeks if you wanted some breathing room.</p>

<p>I’m headed to Sri Lanka to learn to surf, then I’m coming back to Taiwan and going down the east coast. If you’ve ever thought about biking Taiwan but were intimidated by the lack of English information, don’t be. Just get an MRT to Damsui, rent a bike and go.<script type="text/javascript">/<em> </em> <em> CONFIGURATION VARIABLES </em> <em> </em>/ var disqus_shortname = ‘nick-budden’; /<em> </em> <em> DON’T EDIT BELOW THIS LINE </em> <em> </em>/ (function() { var dsq = document.createElement(‘script’); dsq.type = ‘text/javascript’; dsq.async = true; dsq.src = ‘//‘ + disqus_shortname + ‘.disqus.com/embed.js’; (document.getElementsByTagName(‘head’)[0] || document.getElementsByTagName(‘body’)[0]).appendChild(dsq); })();</script></p>

But with two years abroad I had skipped one Christmas at home with my family, my mother wasn’t going to let me get away with skipping another, so after two years abroad I was coming home for the first time – I decided to take the opportunity to make up for lost ground, and experience as much of Canada as I could.</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<h3 id="So-I-decided-to-take-the-train-across-Canada-from-coast-to-coast"><a href="#So-I-decided-to-take-the-train-across-Canada-from-coast-to-coast" class="headerlink" title="So I decided to take the train across Canada, from coast to coast."></a>So I decided to take the train across Canada, from coast to coast.</h3><p>I’d start my trip in Vancouver, and I’d end in Halifax. Actually technically I started in Victoria, taking a bus into Vancouver to catch my train. My home province of Nova Scotia isn’t quite as east as you can go, but the train doesn’t go all the way to Newfoundland &amp; Labrador and we hit the Atlantic Ocean at Nova Scotia, so it’s fair to call it a cross-Canada trip. Before leaving I’d google for any bloggers who had done the same trip and they were claiming their “cross-Canada” trip to go all the way from Vancouver to Toronto, which is a good way to piss off anyone from Canada’s east coast.</p>
<p>It’s not as crazy as it sounds. Actually, it’s pretty awesome. Via Rail has some <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.viarail.ca/en/fares-and-packages/rail-passes">rail passes</a> that will take you right across the country. At 25 years old they still consider me a youth, so I got to buy a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.viarail.ca/en/fares-and-packages/rail-passes/canrailpass-system">youth Canrailpass – System</a> pass which gave me 7 one-way tickets across the country. Because I was traveling in winter which is Via Rail’s low season, I didn’t have to worry much about availability and got to book each leg of my trip only a few days in advance (or sometimes the day of), figuring out my trip one step at a time.</p>
<p>Via Rail is pretty awesome in just about every way. In the first leg of my trip I met a professional chef from Korea who had just finished his working holiday in Canada, and even he couldn’t stop talking about how great the food in the restaurant was (and it wasn’t expensive either). Different trains were staffed by different chefs, and later chefs were still really good, but the chef on this first leg was amazing and you could overhear that the conversation at every table in the restaurant constantly drifted back to how good the food was. Via Rail has also got a program where they invite musicians to travel for free, in exchange for performing for the trains passengers. This meant we had live music on the train a few times per day, and we’d also get a quick show anytime we had an extended layover in the waiting area of the train station.</p>

<p>I had to get home to Nova Scotia before a family Christmas party, so I didn’t have time to stop all the places I wanted and only used 4 of my 7 tickets, but this was still an amazing way to see Canada. With more time to make more stops, it would have been even better.</p>
<p>My first leg went from Vancouver to Edmonton, with a short stop in Jasper. I’ve got family in Calgary, so I planned to get on a bus and head straight to Calgary, but the train was a bit late so I missed the bus (you should plan on the train being up to a few hours late). My friend from Korea also had friends in Calgary, had the same plan as me and also missed his bus, so we had a night in Edmonton. We didn’t want to pay for a hotel because the next bus left about 6 hours from that time, so we went for some beers and pulled an all nighter, ending up at Denny’s taking shifts on who sleeps and who stays awake.</p>
<iframe frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.facebook.com/video/embed?video_id=10153660626865720" width="450"></iframe>

<p>After a few days with family in Calgary, I went back up to Edmonton to attend a startup event and get to know the city. I expected Edmonton to be a bit of an oil town, but it’s got heart and I actually really like it there. The downtown is pretty nice, and plenty of coffee shops to write code if you’re a nerd like me. From Edmonton for lack of time I got the train straight to Toronto. I got great views of the prairies, but not having got out of the train to properly experience them I still count the prairies as on my “to-visit” list.</p>
<p>With the train, you can get either seats or a sleeping car, but if you buy the pass like I did you’ll be restricted to the seats. That said, the seats are not that bad. Imagine an airplane seat that’s about twice as wide, 3-4 times the legroom, reclines about twice as far, and even has a footrest that raises up something like a reclining chair in your living room. On top of that because it was low season the seat next to you was rarely taken, so you could recline both chairs and make something of a bed out of it.</p>
<iframe frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.facebook.com/video/embed?video_id=10153497411475720" width="450"></iframe>

<p>After arriving in Toronto, I spent about a week making friends at the local hostel, exploring the city, and meeting up with a few friends who had moved there. Toronto is a city I had never been to, and I was surprised how nice it was considering how much Canadians from outside Toronto like to talk bad about it. After a few days eating Poutine (yes, everyday) in Montreal, I was back in my home of Nova Scotia, having made the trip from coast to coast by land.</p>
<p>As a special note for designers/coders (or others who work from home). The train is a pretty awesome place to get work done, and that’s part of the reason I wanted to travel this way. There’s a plug at every seat, and though certain legs of the trip don’t have wifi a few distraction free days on the train is probably one of the best ways to travel and work at the same time.</p>
<p>Traveling across Canada by train, you should do it. As in really, you should do it. Here’s the link, go buy a ticket: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.viarail.ca/en/fares-and-packages/rail-passes/canrailpass-system">Vail Rail Passes</a>.</p>

<p>I just came back from 22 days trekking the Annapurna Circuit in Nepal, with a few side treks including one to Tilicho lake.</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<p>Before this trip I’d never been on a mountain (at least without a snowboard and a chairlift) so certain parts of the trek seemed pretty scary to me, one in particular on the way to Tilicho lake where a permanent sign said “Landslide” and you walked across about a foot-wide trail on a face of broken rock, with about a thousand meters of rock above you ready to fall on you, and a few thousand meters of the face below you that you’d roll down if you lost your footing (I wrote that it was 1,000 meter drop in the section below, but later learned that it was quite a lot more). I don’t keep a diary, but I’ve got a book to draw website designs in, so when I got to the other side I wrote this down so that I’d remember the experience:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I just came through the scariest climb yet, walking through what seemed to be a gravel mountainside, with warnings of falling rocks from above and the reward of a 1,000 meter drop below should you fall. The trail was barely a foot wide, and in some places only wide enough for a single step, forcing you to walk tight-rope style for over an hour while constantly listening for falling rocks from above. I could see this section of trail long before I reached it, which meant building up the tension and nervousness. Luckily, just before entering the section I saw a French man, alone like me, emerging from it. I’d met him a few days earlier and he assured me that if I went slow and steady, I’d be fine. Because he’d just done so, his advice calmed me right before entering. I tightened up my backpack and hunched over to keep my centre of gravity right over my feet. I spent the next hour walking over the section like this, and though I seemed to get altitude sickness halfway through (I felt a bit lightheaded and my vision lagged), I made it to the other side alive. I’m going to spend the night at Tilicho base camp to make sure I’m fully acclimatized, then make for the lake tomorrow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It actually only turned out to be scary because I wasn’t use to it, and really wasn’t that bad. The next day when I had to walk across the same section, now that I was use to it, I pretty much just walked across the same way I’d walk down a sidewalk.</p>
<div id="disqus_thread"></div></div></article><article><div class="post_title"><h1><a href="/Nagarkot-Nepal/">Nagarkot, Nepal</a></h1><p class="date">Saturday, July 27th 2013</p><ul class="tags"><li><a href="/tags/Travel/">Travel</a></li></ul></div><div class="post_content"><p>I spent about a week and a half in Nagarkot, which is on the outskirts of the Kathmandu Valley in Nepal. You can see Kathmandu and it’s neighbouring city Bhaktapur from the mountaintops in Nagarkot, but it’s a world away. Before going to Nagarkot I was in Kathmandu trying to use Google to find the best next stop, but when it came to Nagarkot I couldn’t find much info that wasn’t related to trekking (actually it’s hard to find any information related to Nepal that isn’t related to trekking). So, now that I’ve been there, I wanted to share what you can do in Nagarkot that’s not trekking-related.</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<p>So, what can you do in Nagarkot? Not much, but that’s kind of the point. Nagarkot is a small village at the top of a mountain, and it’s likely one of the most relaxed places I’ve ever visited combined with some of the nicest people. My days primarily consisted of hanging out in my hotel, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.endoftheuniverse.com.np/">The End of the Universe</a>, which is a group of cabins on the edge of the town. The staff there were amazing, several different people happened to be staying there for an extended time just like myself, and along with the staff we became friends. When the staff’s workload lightened at the end of each night, they more often than not started playing music, singing with the guests, and teaching us Nepali dance. I now know that to dance like a Nepali you just have to either pretend to unscrew lightbulbs or pretend to ride a motorcycle.</p>
<p>This video gives a good idea of what a night in the hotel was like more often than not, and you were always invited to join.</p>
<iframe frameborder="0" height="356" src="https://www.facebook.com/video/embed?video_id=10153045096860720" width="200"></iframe>

<p>Around the town of Nagarkot you’re just going to want to spend your time relaxing, and maybe head out for a walk each day. I’m not an expert on trekking, but around Nagarkot I’d say it’s more like a nice walk than trekking. There are trails around the town that you can take which have been specifically built for tourists (though there were not many tourists there when I visited in the off-season), but there are also many many roads and trails that the locals use to get around, and these were always my favorite.</p>

<p>A quick video from one of these roads is posted below to give you an idea of what to expect.</p>
