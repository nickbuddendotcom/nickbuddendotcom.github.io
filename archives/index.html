This post is an RFP for such a framework. I am hoping that someone may be able to point me in the right direction to gain one (or ideally, several) practical mental-models on determination.</p>
<p>I hope to use this framework when hiring new team members (as a pre-hire test/assesment), or when training existing team members (as a framework to aide coaching, and/or a framework they may adopt in self-directed learning). Or simply anywhere the topic of determination comes up, and someone wants some practical help to increase it.</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<p>I seem to be very determined. ‚ÄòDetermined‚Äô is the always among the first word friends, fellow-founders, investors, coworkers, etc. will use to describe me, pretty much without exception. For all the good and bad about my character, it‚Äôs probably fair to say determination is in the ‚Äòpros‚Äô column.</p>
<p>However I have never successfully translated my own determination into either <strong>(1)</strong> evaluating another person‚Äôs determination (i.e. in a job interview) or <strong>(2)</strong> helping lead another person to cultivate and grow their own determination (i.e. in coaching, leadership, management).</p>
<p>I have tried both (1) and (2) many times but always failed. </p>
<p>I hope to change that. If you can help point me in the right direction, please do. üòä</p>

<h2 id="What-is-a-‚ÄòFramework‚Äô"><a href="#What-is-a-‚ÄòFramework‚Äô" class="headerlink" title="What is a ‚ÄòFramework‚Äô?"></a>What is a ‚ÄòFramework‚Äô?</h2><p>Here, by Framework or Mental Model I mean a set of research-based practices that someone may practically act upon. Ideally a structured practice, which is (at least somewhat) objectively-observable.</p>
<p>Some examples of practical frameworks in other areas:</p>

</ul>
<p>These are just off the top of my head. Each of the frameworks or mental-models above are ones that have come up in my life in the past week or so, so are just top-of-mind. Most of them are well-researched (except NVC).</p>
<p>They work, and they are practical. The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://fs.blog/mental-models/">mental models help you think better</a> and the frameworks describe a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://jamesclear.com/deliberate-practice-theory">deliberate practice</a> to make  progress in real life (while ‚Äúdeliberate practice‚Äù is, itself, a mental-model - see how that‚Äôs useful?).</p>
<p>In leadership I want to find a framework (or at least, a mental-model) to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(1)</strong> evaluate determination in someone (i.e. in a job interview); or </li>
<li><strong>(2)</strong> help guide someone to cultivate determination (i.e. coaching).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I know of no such framework or practical mental-model for determination.</strong> üòïüò¢ I would really like to find one (or better yet, several). </p>
<p>I hope you can point me in a good direction.</p>

<h3 id="Self-Deception-in-Self-Evaluation"><a href="#Self-Deception-in-Self-Evaluation" class="headerlink" title="Self-Deception in Self-Evaluation"></a>Self-Deception in Self-Evaluation</h3><p>First, an aside‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Finding relatively objectively-observable frameworks seems to be particularly important when it comes to determination. Objectively-observable rather than say, basing things on someone‚Äôs self-evaluation: i.e. <em>‚Äòhow determined do you think you are?‚Äô</em> or ‚Äò<em>in what situation do you think you showed most determination?‚Äô</em>.</p>
<p>This is because most people (or more specifically, most people‚Äôs ego) seems to have an immunity to reality, when it comes to determination. Rationalizations mean their self-evaluations are, often, really just self-deceptions. </p>
<p>When most people faced with tough challenges give up to avoid the pain and discomfort that comes with tough challenges, they will rationalize it to keep their ego intact. They avoid both the challenge, and the defeat.</p>
<p><img src="/images/Determination/determination-flow.png" alt="Determination Flow" title="Determination"></p>
<p>And they believe their rationalizations (at least, conciousely). Even when these rationalizations contradict the beliefs and values they <em>say</em> they have, they‚Äôll jiu-jitsu their reasoning in strange acrobatics until they have rationalizations that seem at least somewhat justifyable, to avoid challenge (its pain, discomfort).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúI have seen CEOs try to cope with the stress by drinking heavily, checking out, and even quitting. In each case, the CEO has a marvelous rationalization why it was OK for him to punk out or quit, but none them will ever be great CEOs. Great CEOs face the pain.‚Äù <strong>‚á¢ from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/03/31/what%E2%80%99s-the-most-difficult-ceo-skill-managing-your-own-psychology/">Ben Horowitz, What‚Äôs The Most Difficult CEO Skill? Managing Your Own Psychology.</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These rationalizations preserve ego by concealing (or at least, trying to‚Ä¶) the gap between a person‚Äôs: </p>
<ul>
<li>(1) <strong>Espoused Theory of Action</strong> (what they <strong><em>say about themselves</em></strong>); and </li>
<li>(2) <strong>Theory-in-use</strong> (what they <strong><em>actually do</em></strong>; despite what they say)</li>
</ul>
<p><small><em>(‚á¢ see <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.aral.com.au/resources/argyris.html">this for summary</a> on Chris Argyris‚Äô work: or others on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://actiondesign.com/resources/readings/action-science">Action Science</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://fs.blog/2018/06/double-loop-learning/">Double Loop Learning</a>)</em></small></p>
<p>I mention this because at least to me, this gaps often seems very large for most people, when it comes to determination. People think they are determined, but they don‚Äôt act that way‚Ä¶yet when they don‚Äôt act that way they fall-back on rationalizing-away the need to. </p>
<p>So, maintain their self-perception of high determination (their ego). It‚Äôs sort of a cycle, where the undetermined protect themselves from that realization (and therefore, never work on it). It‚Äôs a generalization not a rule, but seems to be majority-accurate.</p>
<p><em>(this poor self-evaluation of determination is why I made a point of mentioning that it is others who evaluate me as determined earlier, rather than evaluating myself that way)‚Ä¶</em></p>
<p>And since I hope to find a Determination Framework or mental-model for leadership purposes, in order to‚Ä¶</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(1)</strong> evaluate determination in someone (i.e. in a job interview); or </li>
<li><strong>(2)</strong> help guide someone to cultivate determination (i.e. coaching)</li>
</ul>
<p>‚Ä¶any useful framework will therefore need to help make someone‚Äôs <strong>Theory-in-use</strong> (<strong>what they <em>actually do</em></strong>) apparent and relatively objective to both myself, and the other person. </p>
<p>If the framework only dismantles rationalizations ‚Äòafter the fact‚Äô when determination has already failed, it will not be very useful in leadership of others. </p>
<p>The rationalizations themselves, are not real. Kill one and another will take its place like a game of whack-a-mole. So as a leader I really want a framework that will dig into the root. To help someone objectively see their determination in an intellecutally-honest way, and help them cultivate it. </p>

<h2 id="Known-Frameworks-to-me"><a href="#Known-Frameworks-to-me" class="headerlink" title="Known Frameworks (to me)"></a>Known Frameworks (to me)</h2><p>There are a few semi-related frameworks I already know about. Most are well-researched. All have been very effective for me personally in my own growth, but have been relatively less effective in leadership.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="Action-Science"><a href="#Action-Science" class="headerlink" title="Action Science"></a>Action Science</h4><p>I‚Äôve mentioned the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://actiondesign.com/resources/readings/action-science">Action Science</a> framework a few times above. It‚Äôs a set of practices developed mostly by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Argyris">Chris Argyris</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sch%C3%B6n">Donald Sch√∂n</a>. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs a bit too big to summarize here. You can maybe <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.aral.com.au/resources/argyris.html">read this link</a>. </p>
<p>For our purposes here let‚Äôs say that Action Science is a set of tools which help to dig beyond an Espoused Theory (what someone <em>say</em> about themselves) and into a Theory-in-use (what they <em>actually do</em>). </p>
<p>It‚Äôs a great tool for leaders and organizations. Like, really great. However it has not been particularly helpful in aiding determination.</p>
<p>It is somewhat helpful because if you‚Äôre going to play whack-a-mole exposing rationalizations, at least Action Science is a good way to do it.</p>
<p>However I‚Äôm not sure it will help me: <strong>(1)</strong> evaluate determination (i.e. in a job interview); <strong>(2)</strong> cultivate determination (i.e. as a coach).</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="Responsability-Process"><a href="#Responsability-Process" class="headerlink" title="Responsability Process"></a>Responsability Process</h4><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urcezKRhpoY">Christopher Avery</a> describes the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/Responsibility-Process-Unlocking-Natural-Ability/dp/099774720X">Responsability Process</a> mental-model as a series of progressively-mature mindsets on responsability. He‚Äôs likely expanding on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Grove">Andy Grove</a>‚Äòs similar responsability framework in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove/dp/0679762884">High Output Management</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/Determination/Responsibility.png" alt="Responsability Process" title="Responsability Process"></p>
<p>In this sense ‚Äòresponsibility‚Äô and ‚Äòdetermination‚Äô are pretty much the same thing. The responsible person here will not move down and to the left on the ladder away from responsibility, by creating rationalizations that blame others or blame circumstace, to talk themselves out of acting in a determined way.</p>
<p>It works by using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_reframing">cognitive reframing</a> to recognize your rationalizations for what they are, then reframe the thought into something healthier (i.e. reframe your way from denial ‚á¢ through to responsability).</p>
<p>I (personally) love this mental-model and Avery gives some advice on turning the mental-model into practical Framework in real life. It‚Äôs great. Like, really great. Implementing this type of reframed thinking leads to a better life (at least, according to me). It‚Äôs that good.</p>
<p>But I have not found it that helpful as a leader to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(1)</strong> evaluate determination (i.e. in an interview)</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond the basics of watching out for someone who ‚Äòblames others‚Äô, in an interview. You can catch the blame game easily, when evaluating someone. However the absense of blaming others is not far enough up the Responsibility ladder to really demonstrate a person‚Äôs determination.</p>
<p>Evaluating the higher-rungs of the ladder via conversation (i.e. in an interview) I have found to be much more difficult than evaluating the lower-rungs (which is fairly easy).</p>
<p>Though it has been somewhat helpful in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(2)</strong> cultivating determination (i.e. as a coach)</li>
</ul>
<p>‚Ä¶but on #2, only somewhat. I find it extremely effective personally, but it does not seem to work well when given to others as Avery himself points out. This tool only works with deep buy-in from the practitioner, which makes it somewhat less effective as a coaching tool for leaders.</p>
<p>It can work sometimes, but only in those cases where the person you are coaching is already intrinsically bought-in to the process. In other words, it works when self-directed. You can recommend the process to someone, but you cannot do much more than that.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="Challenge-vs-Threat-Response"><a href="#Challenge-vs-Threat-Response" class="headerlink" title="Challenge vs. Threat Response"></a>Challenge vs. Threat Response</h4><p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://kellymcgonigal.com/think-like-a-champion">Threat Response ‚á¢ to ‚á¢ Challenge Response</a> Framework is also a type of Cognitive Reframing. For more you can see <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/Upside-Stress-Why-Good-You/dp/1101982934">Kelly McGonigal‚Äôs work</a>. </p>
<p>Where in Avery‚Äôs Framework you take an absense of responsability and shift it to a responsible mindset, in McGonigal‚Äôs you take a feeling of stress and shift it to a feeling of growth-inducing challenge.</p>
<div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RcGyVTAoXEU" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Both the responsibility to view challenges positively (Avery), and the conversion of negative-stress into viewing challenges as opportunities for growth, are helpful and practical frameworks in building determination.</p>
<p>This model has been the most helpful to me in (1) evaluating (i.e. in a job interview) but asking someone to change how they think hasn‚Äôt been very practical to (2) cultivate (i.e. as a coach).</p>
<p>Sure, it works. But it only works if the person actually does it. Suggesting the model in 1-1‚Äôs with team members typically isn‚Äôt very effective, to lead to actual execution. You can‚Äôt force someone.</p>
<p>Her <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/Upside-Stress-Why-Good-You/dp/1101982934">book is good</a> if you‚Äôre interested in the science.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="So‚Ä¶"><a href="#So‚Ä¶" class="headerlink" title="So‚Ä¶"></a>So‚Ä¶</h1><p>When it comes to evaluating determination (i.e. in a job interview) no tool has really been helpful. When it comes to cultivating determination (i.e. as a coach) some can kind-of, sort-of help but only to the extent they pick-apart and dismantle rationalizations to expose them for what they are. </p>
<p>But‚Ä¶by the time you‚Äôre dismantling rationalizations, playing rationalization whack-a-mole, it‚Äôs often already too late. Determination has failed, and the time to either evaulate for it or to cultivate it as a leader has already past. In other words, you have failed as a leader, leading to a failure in determination.</p>
<p>Frameworks like Action Science can be used proactively to deeply engage with root causes at a level that most teams and most leaders never achieve. However, though it can bring great clarity to just about anything, it does not touch on the emotional and human aspects of determination. </p>
<p>You could use Action Science to objectively talk about determination with someone, but it is not really a framework for that person to cultivate their determination proactively.</p>
<p>I hope to find a framework (or mental-model) that can be <strong><em>proactively effective</em></strong> at the level of evaluating and cultivating <strong>determination itself</strong> (not at the <em>reactive level</em> of dismantling rationalizations objectively,after determination has already failed).</p>

<p>The habit of failure is purely mental and is the mother of fear. This habit gets itself fixed on men because they lack vision. They start out to do something that reaches from A to Z. At A they fail, at B they stumble, and at C they meet with what seems to be an insuperable difficulty. They then cry ‚ÄúBeaten‚Äù and throw the whole task down. They have not even given themselves a chance really to fail; they have not given their vision a chance to be proved or disproved. They have simply let themselves be beaten by the natural difficulties that attend every kind of effort.<br>.<br>More men are beaten than fail. It is not wisdom they need or money, or brilliance, or ‚Äúpull,‚Äù but just plain gristle and bone. This rude, simple, primitive power which we call ‚Äústick-to-it-iveness‚Äù is the uncrowned king of the world of endeavour. People are utterly wrong in their slant upon things. They see the successes that men have made and somehow they appear to be easy. But that is a world away from the facts. It is failure that is easy. Success is always hard. A man can fail in ease; he can succeed only by paying out all that he has and is. It is this which makes success so pitiable a thing if it be in lines that are not useful and uplifting. <strong>‚á¢ Henry Ford, My Life and Work</strong></p>

<h3 id="Deliberate-Practice-in-Daily-Life"><a href="#Deliberate-Practice-in-Daily-Life" class="headerlink" title="Deliberate Practice in Daily Life"></a>Deliberate Practice in Daily Life</h3><p>First, a bit about how these habits took form.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve done some things for years ‚Äî like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/">Gettings Things Done</a>, for example. However in the past my habits were very ad-hoc‚Ä¶like most people‚Äôs, I guess.</p>
<p>I had some good habits, but I didn‚Äôt write them down, regularly reflect on how to improve them, or deeply research new habits for areas I wanted to improve, etc‚Ä¶</p>
<p>It was all ad-hoc, until mid-last year when that changed.</p>
<p>This is when I did deep research (and as a result, created structured practices) for getting better sleep. They worked really, really well. Insomnia problems I‚Äôd had my whole life were completely gone, within weeks.</p>
<p>Because it worked so well I quickly began taking this same more thoughtful, structured, and reflective approach to other areas of my life and work.</p>
<p>Today I think of this way of viewing my daily habits as an implementation of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://jamesclear.com/deliberate-practice-theory">Deliberate Practice</a> in my everyday life. I‚Äôve been living this way for maybe ~1.5-years now.</p>
<p>Living this way is without a doubt one of the most important, positively-impactful, high-leverage changes I‚Äôve ever made in my life.</p>

It‚Äôs a personal productivity system described in a book by the same name.</p>
<p>From the book website‚Äôs about page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GTD enables greater performance, capacity, and innovation. It alleviates the feeling of overwhelm‚Äîinstilling focus, clarity, and confidence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my own experience, and the experience of many people I work with (lots of us use GTD), that statement is completely true. It‚Äôs most important impact for me has been the degree to which is frees my mind for clear thought.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve recommended GTD to a lot of people. Roughly half have taken me up on it, and those that have seem to love it as much as I do. It takes time to implement but is well, well worth it. It makes people less stressed, and happier.</p>

<p>The above is a summary of GTD‚Äôs practices. However you really have to experience the impact these practices have yourself, to get it. So <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0143126563">get the book</a> and give it a try, if you‚Äôre interested.</p>
<p>I use an app called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/">Omnifocus</a> on my Mac and iPhone to implement GTD, and this is how I‚Äôve set up my projects:</p>

<p>I use a number of tags as well, but I think the only ones important to talk about here are <strong>focus</strong>, <strong>&gt;10min</strong>, and <strong>low-energy</strong>.</p>
<p>The focus tags represent tasks that require 3-5 hours of focused, uninterrupted work. The others, of course, are the opposite. I‚Äôll talk about why these are important to me in the section on my routine.</p>
<p>I do two things in GTD not explicitly recommended by the book.</p>
<ol>
<li>I create many ‚Äòreflection‚Äô tasks. These are not really ‚Äúnext-actions‚Äù. They are future reminders to think (or, re-think) on a specific topic.</li>
<li>I do short reviews <em>daily</em> (‚â† <del>weekly</del>). It‚Äôs more manageable, since I have a lot of tasks, and it lets me prioritize tomorrow‚Äôs work, and the end of today.</li>
<li>I tag some large tasks as <strong>macros</strong>. This means I have not yet broken them down into next-actions. I‚Äôll break them down later, when it‚Äôs nearing the time to actually work on them.</li>
</ol>
<p>Moving on now from GTD, I also use an app called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://toggl.com/">Toggl</a> to track (<em>minute-by-minute</em>) how I use my time each workday. This started as an experiment based on Peter Drucker‚Äôs advice that: <em>‚Äúone cannot even think of managing one‚Äôs time unless one first knows where it goes.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>The experiment was meant to last only 1-2 weeks. At the end, I‚Äôd reflect on how I‚Äôd spent my time, adjust my habits accordingly, then repeat the experiment at regular intervals of a few months.</p>
<p>However, I found it so useful (and so much easier than I expected) that now, I always do it. It‚Äôs not a fixed-length experiment, anymore. I expected logging my day into Toggl to be a pain, but it was not.</p>
<p>I also keep a note pinned to the top of my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a>, called <strong>Thinking Out Loud</strong>. It‚Äôs a place where I can write, stream of conciousness-style, whatever I need to think-through during the day. <em>Think and write, think and write‚Ä¶</em></p>
<p>At the end of each workday I empty my <strong>Thinking Out Loud</strong> note as part of inbox-zero, and so I (re)process this information at end-of-day in whatever way is required (i.e. creating GTD next-actions). Of course, I also inbox-zero my email and my Omnifocus inbox at the same time.</p>
<p>Lastly, I try (but sometimes fail) to manage my time according to a philosophy of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/building-asana/work-hard-live-well-ead679cb506d">Live Well</a>, which means being thoughtful about the number of hours I work each day to maintain my productivity over time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More than a century of studies show that long-term useful worker output is maximized near a five-day, 40-hour workweek. Productivity drops immediately upon starting overtime and continues to drop until, at approximately eight 60-hour weeks, the total work done is the same as what would have been done in eight 40-hour weeks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above quote is from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.igda.org/page/crunchsixlessons">Why Crunch Modes Doesn‚Äôt Work: Six Lessons</a>, a study of software engineers‚Äô productivity and total output by work-hours.</p>
<p>This reality has been shown to be true <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.economist.com/free-exchange/2014/12/09/proof-that-you-should-get-a-life">over</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://ftp.iza.org/dp8129.pdf">over again</a>. We can work long hours and get more done in short bursts of 6-8 weeks at a time, but soon that increased productivity will evaporate or even reverse.</p>
<p>Despite this being proven true (repeatedly), some people still reject it, and we even <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3038954/why-rectifying-our-culture-of-overwork-is-easier-said-than-done">experience guilt</a> over it. Intuitively, it just feels wrong.</p>
<p><em>Why?</em></p>
<p>Well, from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fifth_Discipline">Peter Senge‚Äôs Fifth Discipline</a>, on systems thinking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>THE DELUSION OF LEARNING FROM EXPERIENCE:</p>
<p>The most powerful learning comes from direct experience. Indeed, we learn eating, crawling, walking, and communicating through direct trial and error‚Äîthrough taking an action and seeing the consequences of that action; then taking a new and different action. But what happens when we can no longer observe the consequences of our actions? What happens if the primary consequences of our actions are in the distant future or in a distant part of the larger system within which we operate? We each have a ‚Äúlearning horizon,‚Äù a breadth of vision in time and space within which we assess our effectiveness. When our actions have consequences beyond our learning horizon, it becomes impossible to learn from direct experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, what does this mean? Well, I‚Äôve spent 1-hour writing this blog post so far. If I extend that to 2-hours I‚Äôll get more done, right? Yes, I will.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs a simple, direct experience that tells me working a longer amount of time produces more work output. It‚Äôs where most people‚Äôs intuition comes from.</p>
<p>But the accumulated, eventual consequences of long work-hours summed over a long period of time is outside our <em>learning horizon</em>. So, we‚Äôre just <strong>not very good at intuiting it</strong>. Our spidey-sense often malfunctions when projected onto complex systems like this.</p>
<p>Anyway, I‚Äôm a workaholic by nature (<em>just ask those who know me‚Ä¶</em>). So it‚Äôs actually <em>easier</em> for me to <em>work longer hours</em> than it is to restrict myself. It comes naturally, while restricting myself does not.</p>
<p>However, alongside some other members of our team at Phase, I‚Äôve learned to become a lot better at this. It‚Äôs more productive (i.e. it works), because it‚Äôs not about working ‚Äòless hard‚Äô.</p>
<p>From <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/danielgross?lang=en">Daniel Gross</a> at his YC Startup School talk on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/LH1bewTg-P4">How to Win</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wanna be clear‚Ä¶<em>I‚Äôm not proposing you don‚Äôt work hard</em>. In order to win, you have to work hard. <em>I‚Äôm proposing you don‚Äôt moronically work hard</em>, and like, not sleep. Because then, you‚Äôre gonna have to work much harder, even, to catch up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It‚Äôs about working with higher intensity, focus, and energy. That‚Äôs what restricting my work-hours each day to what‚Äôs been proven best, allows me to do. <em>It actually helps me work harder</em>.</p>
<p>For someone naturally inclined to working long hours (and enjoying it), restricting has eventually turned each day into a full-tilt, high-energy sprint of work. The sum of those daily, high-energy sprints is greater output than the previous long-hours marathons.</p>
<p>So today I encourage everyone to follow <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3021905/hemingways-secret-to-maintaining-productive-momentum">Hemingway‚Äôs advice</a>, <em>‚ÄúThe important thing is to have good water in the well‚Ä¶and it is better to take a regular amount out than to pump the well dry and wait for it to refill.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>The overwhelming body of research is, well‚Ä¶correct (<em>‚Ä¶duh</em> (-_-)).</p>
<p>One final note is that despite everything I just said, I actually do still work long-hours, sometimes. I just try to be thoughtful about it, and exercise some control over when I make that short-term tradeoff.</p>
<p>I can give myself a short-term boost only a few times each year, so I want to use them wisely. It‚Äôs how I try to work both hard and smart.</p>

<h2 id="Learning"><a href="#Learning" class="headerlink" title="Learning"></a>Learning</h2><p>I ‚ù§ learning - my role model in this is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://firstround.com/review/How-to-Win-as-a-First-Time-Founder-a-Drew-Houston-Manifesto/">Drew Houston, of Dropbox</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚Ä¶every weekend, I would take this folding chair up to the roof with all these books I got on Amazon. I would just sit there and read all of them. I would spend the whole weekend just reading, reading, reading.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There‚Äôs a copy of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/Poor-Charlies-Almanack-Charles-Expanded/dp/1578645018">Poor Charlie‚Äôs Almanac</a> beside me as I type this, so let me inject a comment from Munger here too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my whole life I have known no wise people (over a broad subject matter area) who didn‚Äôt read all the time ‚Äî none, zero. You‚Äôd be amazed at how much Warren reads ‚Äî and how much I read. My children laugh at me. They think I‚Äôm a book with a couple of legs sticking out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think I probably read about as much as Drew Houston says he does, which I suspect is a whole lot less than Munger. The total # of books I read isn‚Äôt that high though, because I tend to re-read (good) books more than I read new ones.</p>
<p>In learning I also spend time with (and learn from) peers and mentors as well, but let me focus here on my reading and study habits here. I rambled a bit in the Productivity section, so let‚Äôs just get right to it:</p>
<p><strong>Daily Review : Reading</strong></p>
<p>I keep a list of the best blog posts I‚Äôve ever read in my Omnifocus, inside a note in a recurring tasks to read at the end of each workday.</p>
<p>When I do this task each day I‚Äôll either take one of those saved links and re-read it, or I‚Äôll search out something new. It depends how I feel.</p>
<p>If I read something new and it‚Äôs good, I‚Äôll add it to the re-read list for next time, so this list keeps growing.</p>
<p><strong>Weekly Review : Summaries</strong></p>
<p>When I read non-fiction (i.e. work) books, I do it with a printed-paper physical book rather than audiobook or PDF, and I do it with a highlighter. When done, I create bullet-point summary references of the best books.</p>
<p>Each Friday I review one of these summaries.</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄúThink Time‚Äù</strong></p>
<p>After my whole workday is done, I have something I just call ‚ÄòThink Time‚Äô. Often I‚Äôll just sit in a park alone to think, undistracted. However just as often I‚Äôll (re)read something that helps me grow in <em>how I think.</em></p>
<p>Usually this means a book on Stoicism (‚ù§ Stoicism‚Ä¶), but right now it means reading <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/Poor-Charlies-Almanack-Charles-Expanded/dp/1578645018">Poor Charlie‚Äôs Almanac</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Weekends</strong></p>
<p>Of course, plenty of ad-hoc reading, especially on the weekends.</p>
<p><strong>Fiction, Audio-Books</strong></p>
<p>Every night just before (and just after) I go to bed I read fiction on audiobook, to unwind. Right now it‚Äôs <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time">The Wheel of Time</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Journaling"><a href="#Journaling" class="headerlink" title="Journaling"></a>Journaling</h2><p>Journaling isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôd have expected to like. However it has become a huge part of my life.</p>
<p>I have a few different journaling practices. Some are focused on my work, while others just focus on being a better human.</p>
<h3 id="Management-Journals"><a href="#Management-Journals" class="headerlink" title="Management Journals"></a>Management Journals</h3><p>I keep a management journal originally inspired by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://firstround.com/review/the-most-dangerous-leadership-traps-and-the-15-minute-daily-practice-that-will-save-you/">this blog post</a>. I‚Äôve adapted the practice the blog post describes a bit. Today I keep three of these journals in a markdown editor.</p>
<p>One for daily-journals, one for weekly, and one for quarterly.</p>
<p><strong>Daily</strong></p>
<p>The daily are much the same as described in the blog post. That is, I copy the following 3-questions into my journal at the end of each workday, to reflect on the <strong>it</strong>, the <strong>we</strong>, and the <strong>I</strong> for that day.</p>
<p>‚á¢ The It<br><small>Did you execute your work? The stuff you had on your list at the start of the day? Did you do the things that were important and not just urgent? Did I choose to work on things high leverage as a manager? Did I appropriately split my time between CEO-Work Majority and Individual-Contributor Minority? Did I lead? Comprehensively understand my team‚Äôs work in detail? Help align, energize, unblock, and motivate them?</small></p>
<p>‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚á¢ The We<br><small>Did you add value to the lives of the people you interacted with? Did they walk away with more knowledge, energy, goodwill, help, a better understanding? What‚Äôs going well and what created that? What‚Äôs challenging and what created that? What strengths and contributions do I notice in others? Did you take the opportunity to coach?</small></p>
<p>‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚á¢ The I<br><small>How did I manage my energy and mood? Self-care like working out, eating well, and sleeping enough. How do I feel today? What‚Äôs on my mind? What did I learn? What strengths did I notice in myself today? What did I improve in myself (mission, communication, etc)? What could I have done better today? Did I consciously manage my stress?</small></p>
<p>‚Ä¶</p>
<p><strong>Weekly</strong></p>
<p>Weekly journals are different - at the beginning of each quarter I set what are sort of like personal, management, and leadership <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/set-goals-with-okrs/steps/introduction/">OKRs</a>.</p>
<p>In my weekly journals, which I do on Mondays to reflect on the previous week before beginning the new one, I‚Äôve got two sections.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the first section I re-read the previous week‚Äôs daily management journals then summarize and reflect on that week.</li>
<li>In the second section, I reflect on my personal OKRs‚Äô progress.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quarterly</strong></p>
<p>This is the same format as the weekly journal, but applied to reviewing the previous quarter‚Äôs weekly journals.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Life-Journals"><a href="#Life-Journals" class="headerlink" title="Life Journals"></a>Life Journals</h3><p>I use the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glFMpyx_oU4">5-minute Journal</a> format and also the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.chriswinfield.com/morning-pages/">Morning Pages</a>, both of which are Tim Ferris recommendations.</p>
<p>I use to do both every morning, but now I choose one or the other each day. I write both of these longhand, with a physical notebook.</p>
<p><strong>5-Minute Journal</strong></p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://thehustle.co/the-five-minute-journal-will-make-you-happier">5-minute journal</a> is actually two, short journals: one in the morning, and another in the evening. Both take only a few minutes each.</p>
<p>The morning journal has three sections:</p>
<ol>
<li>I‚Äôm Greatful for‚Ä¶ <em>(write 3-things‚Ä¶)</em></li>
<li>What Would Make Today Great?</li>
<li>Daily Affirmation; I am‚Ä¶</li>
</ol>
<p>And the evening journal:</p>
<ol>
<li>Three Amazing Things that Happened Today‚Ä¶</li>
<li>How Could I Have Made Today Better?</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/images/My-Habits/5-Minute-Journal.jpg" alt="5 Minute Journal" title="5 Minute Journal"></p>
<p><strong>Morning Pages</strong></p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.chriswinfield.com/morning-pages/">Morning Pages</a> are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚Ä¶three pages of longhand, stream of consciousness writing, ideally done first thing in the morning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was sceptical of Morning Pages, but have found them hugely helpful. It calms my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_monkey">Monkey Mind</a> to help me focus each day.</p>
<p>I choose to do Morning Pages rather than the 5-Minute Journal maybe, once a week or so, based on how loud my Monkey Mind is that week.</p>

<h1 id="Health"><a href="#Health" class="headerlink" title="Health"></a>Health</h1><h2 id="Sleep"><a href="#Sleep" class="headerlink" title="Sleep"></a>Sleep</h2><p>I use to have lots of trouble with sleep. It‚Äôd take me hours to fall asleep, and once I did I‚Äôd still wake up several times a night. Now though, after years, I‚Äôve solved it.</p>
<p>And it‚Äôs great.</p>
<p>Similar to how working long-hours is counter-productive (read: it‚Äôs dumb), allowing your sleep to suffer in quantity or quality is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.salon.com/2012/03/14/bring_back_the_40_hour_work_week/">at least as bad, or even worse</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚Ä¶knowledge workers [are] exquisitely sensitive to even minor sleep loss. Research by the US military has shown that losing just one hour of sleep per night for a week will cause a level of cognitive degradation equivalent to a .10 blood alcohol level. Worse: most people who‚Äôve fallen into this state typically have no idea of just how impaired they are. It‚Äôs only when you look at the dramatically lower quality of their output that it shows up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We‚Äôre just as bad at intuiting the damage poor sleep has on our productivity (let alone, health) as we are on extended periods of long work-hours.</p>
<p>What‚Äôs worst is just how unaware we are <em>how much our sleep quality suffers</em> due to normal, modern living with things like light pollution, for example.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs something worth investing into, with time and learning. I have solved this for myself, and my life‚Äôs much better as a result.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more someone like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Mtw3vBQYOg">Shawn Stevenson</a> gives good intros on YouTube, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sleep-Smarter-Essential-Strategies-Success/dp/1536618314">has a good book</a> where the majority (though not all) of what he recommends has good backing.</p>
<p>I hope some of what‚Äôs below might help you too.</p>
<p><strong>Device Curfew</strong></p>
<p>Your devices‚Äô (phone, laptop, etc.) <strong>blue lights</strong> are <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/q-a-why-is-blue-light-before-bedtime-bad-for-sleep/">bad for your sleep</a>, and probably <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/using-these-lights-at-night-may-harm-your-health">bad for your health generally</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/My-Habits/bluelight.jpg" alt="Blue Light" title="Blue Light"></p>
<p>The best thing I do is my <strong>device curfew</strong> where I just stop using my devices around 8:00pm. I do some other things too, though.</p>
<p>I use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207513">Night Shift</a> on my Mac and Phone to dim blue light in the evenings. It‚Äôs not powerful enough, though. So I use this <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/dim-the-brightness-of-your-iphone-screen-2015-10">superdim hack</a> too, on my iPhone.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve got a pair of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/Vision-Shield-Computer-Reading-Glasses/dp/B0718XWFWF">bluelight blocking glasses</a> which I use while on my computer during the day.</p>
<p>What I really want (but don‚Äôt have yet) are <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/Lighting-Science-FG-02263-Goodnight-Sleep/dp/B018YIK1X0/ref=sr_1_5?crid=2LSTXVR0P9VWS&amp;keywords=low+blue+light+bulbs&amp;qid=1550367418&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=low+blue%2Caps%2C328&amp;sr=8-5">low bluelight lightbulbs</a> for my bedroom. They should allow me to read before bed, with the light turned on. Right now I‚Äôm squinting at my books in a dark room.</p>
<p><strong>Magnesium Oil</strong></p>
<p>Now, this is awesome.</p>
<p>Magnesium Oil is something you can spray anywhere you feel sore - <em>or just, wherever</em> - right before bed. It <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/article/why-i-slather-my-body-with-magnesium-oil-after-every-hard-workout/">relaxes you</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.tuck.com/magnesium-and-sleep/">generally helps sleep:</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Magnesium regulates both neurotransmitters and melatonin. Neurotransmitters relay messages between your brain and your nervous system, and your melatonin levels control your sleep-wake cycles. Researchers have found that melatonin and magnesium levels correlate in the body. Those with depleted levels experience poorer sleep, and vice versa. Based on these findings, researchers concluded that, like melatonin, magnesium is tied to your circadian rhythms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/images/My-Habits/magnesium-oil.jpg" alt="Magnesium Oil" title="Magnesium Oil"></p>
<p>It really helps me a lot. I‚Äôve given it to a few people and they‚Äôve told me it really helps them, too. One <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/Pure-MAGNESIUM-OIL-Spray-Exceptional/dp/B00Q78C1EW">$20 bottle</a> will probably last you 6-12 months.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs maybe 5¬¢ per night for better sleep? I definitely think it‚Äôs worth it.</p>
<p><strong>Learning to Sleep on my Back</strong></p>
<p>I‚Äôve learned to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tonic.vice.com/en_us/article/qvzpw5/why-you-should-sleep-on-your-back-not-your-stomach">sleep on my back</a> with an ergonomic pillow that has been a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-finds/2018/07/01/pillows-neck-pain/#771b4a8d5182">big help for my neck pain</a>.</p>
<p><strong>LED Light</strong></p>
<p>This was something recommended by Sam Altman in his <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://blog.samaltman.com/productivity">post on productivity
</a>. Specifically he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I use a full spectrum LED light most mornings for about 10-15 minutes while I catch up on email. It‚Äôs great‚Äîif you try nothing else in here, this is the thing I‚Äôd try. It‚Äôs a ridiculous gain for me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I got one too and yup, it‚Äôs great. I turn it on each morning during my journaling right after waking up.</p>
<p><img src="/images/My-Habits/LED.jpg" alt="LED" title="LED"></p>
<p>It energizes me right at the beginning of the day, then in turn helps set consistent circadian rythms for that night‚Äôs sleep.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/Beurer-Daylight-Exceptionally-Simulation-TL30/dp/B01HOBZ066">this one</a> and like it a lot.</p>
<p><strong>ChiliPad</strong></p>
<p>I use something called a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.chilitechnology.com/">ChiliPad</a> to cool my bed. My wife thinks it‚Äôs dumb, but I really like it. I do wish it had more powerful cooling, though (Taiwan is hot).</p>
<p><strong>Apple Cider Vinegar, Honey</strong></p>
<p>I‚Äôm not sure if this works or not, but I enjoy the ritual of making a cup before bed. Grab a cup of water, add 2-3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar, then mix with 1 tablespoon raw honey.</p>
<p>Many <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://sethroberts.net/2013/11/05/honey-at-bedtime-improves-sleep/">swear by it</a>. Google it, you‚Äôll see.</p>
<p><strong>Audiobooks, Fiction @ Night</strong></p>
<p>I read fiction at night via audiobook, to relax. I listen to these audiobooks while falling asleep and use something called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cozyphones.com/">Cozyphones</a> to comfortably wear headphones to bed.</p>
<p>What‚Äôs very nice is that the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cozyphones.com/products/lycra-headband-headphones">Cozyphones for exercise</a> are cool enough to wear to bed in a hot country like Taiwan.</p>

<h2 id="Food-¬±-Supplements"><a href="#Food-¬±-Supplements" class="headerlink" title="Food ¬± Supplements"></a>Food ¬± Supplements</h2><p>Unhealthy eating has for most of my life, been my worst habit. So sometime last year I decided to finally fix this. I spent some weekends learning what I needed to know, then turned that knowledge into a plan for change.</p>
<p><img src="/images/My-Habits/health-plan.gif" alt="My Health Plan" title="My Health Plan"></p>
<p>Below are the habits that have resulted from these changes.</p>
<p><strong>Intermittent Fasting</strong></p>
<p>I do intermittent fasting twice a week, for 24hrs on Tuesdays ‚åø Thursdays.</p>
<p>What does that mean? Well, it just means I eat my last meal on Monday evening, then don‚Äôt eat again until Tuesday evening. Same on Thursday.</p>
<p>I won‚Äôt try to get into <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/intermittent-fasting-surprising-update-2018062914156">the science of intermittent fasting</a> here because it‚Äôs not fresh enough in my mind anymore. If you want to check it out, see <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dietdoctor.com/intermittent-fasting">Jason Fung</a>. He‚Äôs a Canadian doctor who uses intermittent fasting to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/@drjasonfung/towards-reversing-type-2-diabetes-9f693f964f90">help reverse diabetes</a>.</p>
<p>I‚Äôd really like to try longer fasts a la <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/phil-libin-fasting-routine-2017-10">Evernote‚Äôs Phil Libin-style</a>, but I haven‚Äôt yet prioritized the time to try it.</p>
<p><strong>Huel</strong></p>
<p>Most of my meals today are in the form of the unfortunately named, but otherwise awesome, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://huel.com/">Huel</a> powdered food. There‚Äôs a signal vs. noise problem with this type of powered food‚Ä¶so people sometimes mistunderstand it.</p>
<p>Things like Soylent, though well-known, are actually <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://michaelkummer.com/health/is-soylent-healthy/">not that great</a>. The best summaries I‚Äôve found were <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://michaelkummer.com/diet/ample-vs-soylent-comparison-meal-replacement-drinks/">this one</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://michaelkummer.com/health/vegan-meal-replacement-shakes/">this one</a>. I chose Huel because it was healthy, but cheap:</p>

<p>Huel is transparent about the fact that they use conventionally grown, as opposed to organic, ingredients. The primary reason why the company decided to go the conventional route is cost. Huel‚Äôs goal is to deliver a nutritious meal at a low price. By using only organic ingredients, Huel would have to charge more for their product. I appreciate that not everyone can afford pasture-raised meats and organic produce and, thus, consider Huel an excellent alternative. It‚Äôs also worth noting that Huel is non-GMO, even if they don‚Äôt advertise it as such.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I first began eating Huel, for a few days I felt hungry. The amount of food I was eating was small, so my body was all <em>‚Äúwhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù</em></p>
<p>But a few days in my body was all <em>‚Äúoh, I get it‚Ä¶you‚Äôre just not eating crap anymore‚Äù</em>. The amount of food now felt filling, and I started craving Huel, and sort of ‚Äòanti-craving‚Äô what I‚Äôd been eating before.</p>
<p>Huel‚Äôs great for me, and my body knows it.</p>

<p><strong>Coffee</strong></p>
<p>I love coffee, but these days I try to stop drinking it around 2:00pm at the latest. It‚Äôs <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/the-mission/the-latest-time-you-should-drink-coffee-according-to-science-8c1db17bca21">really important for sleep</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Nootrostax Smart</strong></p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.nootrostax.com/products/smart">Nootrostax Smart</a> is a ‚Äòsmart pill‚Äô - it increases memory, focus, energy, etc. I really love it, though I‚Äôm still on a supply of v2, so can‚Äôt speak to v3.</p>
<p><img src="/images/My-Habits/nootrostax.jpg" alt="Nootrostax" title="Nootrostax"></p>
<p><strong>Creatine</strong></p>
<p>I take creatine for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17046034">better cognitive performance</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29704637">improving my memory</a>. The evidence says that long-term use (i.e. years) is just fine.</p>
<p>I take this just before bed, since I‚Äôm taking it mostly to improve short-term memory (which your brain stores at night). I‚Äôm not sure if this timing actually helps, though.</p>
<p><strong>Host Defense Immune Support</strong></p>
<p>I use to get sick all the time, especially when I travelled for work.</p>
<p>So when I was reading <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tim.blog/2017/11/18/under100/">Tribe of Mentors: Most Impactful Purchases of $100 or Less</a> I got excited when I saw <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hostdefense.com/collections/immune-support/products/mycommunity-capsules">Host Defense</a> recommended by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samin_Nosrat">Samin Nosrat</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚Ä¶Host Defense MyCommunity mushroom complex is the most incredible immunity supplement I have ever taken (and I have taken a lot of them!). No matter how much I travel, how many hands I shake, or how exhausted I am, I don‚Äôt get sick as long as I take the supplement diligently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This bunch of mushrooms turns you into Bruce Wilis in Unbreakable. I just don‚Äôt get sick anymore, whereas I use to be sick 1-2 times/month.</p>

<h2 id="Mental-Health"><a href="#Mental-Health" class="headerlink" title="Mental Health"></a>Mental Health</h2><p>While I think journaling and Stoicism are actually the biggest positive contributions to my mental health, meditation is important too.</p>
<p>I use an app called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.headspace.com/">Headspace</a> for guided meditation most mornings, which I do after journaling. I sometimes use it during the day too if I need to do something like increase my focus, or de-stress for a quick 3min.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="Exercise"><a href="#Exercise" class="headerlink" title="Exercise"></a>Exercise</h2><p>Consistent exercise is a problem for me. I enjoy going to the gym, but I travel so often for work that any gym schedule is quickly disrupted.</p>
<p>So for the past few months I‚Äôve been trying a new approach: zero-equipment <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/1/10/18148463/high-intensity-interval-training-hiit-orangetheory">HIIT workouts</a>, that I can do anywhere. Right now this means the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout/">7-minute workout</a> in the mornings with the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://7minuteworkout.jnj.com/">accompanying app</a>, though I may try others soon.</p>
<p>I have yet to see if this‚Äôll hold up when I travel.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="Gear"><a href="#Gear" class="headerlink" title="Gear"></a>Gear</h1><h2 id="Work-Station"><a href="#Work-Station" class="headerlink" title="Work Station"></a>Work Station</h2><p>Work station is a fancy way to say, the stuff I carry in my backpack to use my computer. I use a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.therooststand.com/">Roost Stand</a> with external keyboard and mouse to bring my laptop up to eye level without craning my neck.</p>
<p><img src="/images/My-Habits/roost.png" alt="Roost Stand" title="Roost Stand"></p>
<p>It‚Äôs great. I work on my computer a lot (obviously), and bringing it up to eye level has helped ease some chronic neck pain.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve got reading and writing stands on my desk at home for the same reason. Overcome the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIsx1t8TJq4">nerd neck</a> üöÄ.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="Clothes"><a href="#Clothes" class="headerlink" title="Clothes"></a>Clothes</h2><p>Except for my sweatpants (which I soon hope to replace) my clothes don‚Äôt <em>look much different</em> from anyone else‚Äôs, but they are.</p>
<p>As we grow up we switch from comfortable to uncomfortable clothes, and from functional to un-functional clothes. I think it‚Äôs really, really dumb.</p>
<p>So I try to walk the line wearing clothes that look acceptably-adult, while secretly being more comfortable and functional than the rest of you fools (<em>kidding‚Ä¶</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Shoes</strong></p>
<p>Taiwan is hot, and so are a lot of the countries I travel to. Until recently though, the only shoes I could find to deal with that were sneakers, which I didn‚Äôt want to wear in some work contexts.</p>
<p>But neither did I want to travel with two pairs of shoes, constantly swapping sneakers for work shoes and vice versa.</p>
<p>I finally found the answer in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.colehaan.com/stitchlite">Cole Haan stitchlite</a>. These are perforated, knit-shoes that I actually find even more cooling than sneakers, and they look good too.</p>
<p><img src="/images/My-Habits/stitchlite.png" alt="Stitchlite" title="Stitchlite"></p>
<p>I‚Äôve also got a pair of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.xpandlaces.com/">Xpand no-tie elastic laces</a> in my shoes, because why would I want to sit down every time I want to put my shoes on?</p>
<p>They‚Äôre no-tie, elastic laces for adults.</p>
<p><strong>Merino Wool</strong></p>
<p>I‚Äôve been slowly migrating all my clothing to Merino Wool. It‚Äôs <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ca.icebreaker.com/en/our-story/what-is-merino.html">basically super-fabric</a>, from a New Zealand super-sheep.</p>
<p>It keeps you warm when it‚Äôs cold. It keeps you cool when it‚Äôs hot. It‚Äôs lightweight, strong, and it‚Äôs comfortable. It‚Äôs anti-bacterial, so when you‚Äôre traveling you don‚Äôt have to worry as much about not being able to wash - it won‚Äôt stink.</p>
<p><strong>Pants</strong></p>
<p>Something I haven‚Äôt yet done but really want to is: great pants. Pants that look like jeans, but are actually cool, lightweight, sweatpants-y pants (i.e. comfortable).</p>
<p>It‚Äôs the only remaining the part of my clothing where I‚Äôm full-on little kid (i.e. comfort, function ‚â† <del>style</del>. Now, I‚Äôm usually just in standard sweatpants.</p>
<p>I have my plan, though. I just have to choose which to buy. There are some like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://publicrec.com/products/all-day-every-day-pant-inseam-30">Public Rec</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://westernrise.com/collections/mens-bottoms">Western Rise</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://oliversapparel.com/products/passage-pant">Oliver‚Äôs</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.thunderboltsportswear.com/collections/pants">Thunderbolt</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://snarkynomad.com/soft-shell-jeans-the-worlds-greatest-invention/">plenty of others</a>.</p>
<p>Once I‚Äôve got the money, I‚Äôll get a few pairs.</p>

<h1 id="Routine"><a href="#Routine" class="headerlink" title="Routine"></a>Routine</h1><p>Ok - now, let‚Äôs put this all into the context of a day.</p>
<p>My <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.mi.com/global/miband/">miBand</a> starts a vibrating alarm at 6:15am each morning, but I‚Äôm usually already awake. First thing, I grab my phone for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://7minuteworkout.jnj.com/">7-Minute Exercise</a>. Once done I sit down at my desk for ~10min to meditate with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.headspace.com/">Headspace</a>.</p>
<p>Then I <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/Beurer-Daylight-Exceptionally-Simulation-TL30/dp/B01HOBZ066">switch on my LED</a> and start my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.intelligentchange.com/products/the-five-minute-journal">5-Minute</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.chriswinfield.com/morning-pages/">Morning Pages</a> journal. Finished my journals, then grab my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/NATURELO-Whole-Food-Multivitamin-Men/dp/B01FYDCGZ4?th=1">Naturelo</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.nootrostax.com/products/smart">Nootrostax</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hostdefense.com/collections/immune-support/products/mycommunity-capsules">Host Defense</a> then mix a bottle of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://huel.com/">Huel</a> to drink during my walk to a cafe.</p>
<p><img src="/images/My-Habits/cafe.jpg" alt="Cafe" title="Cafe"></p>
<p>I‚Äôll arrive at a cafe around 7:30am for what I call my <strong>Focus Time</strong>. This is where I focus on one block of work which needs my undivided attention for ~4 hours, in keeping with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Executive-Definitive-Harperbusiness-Essentials/dp/0060833459">Peter Drucker‚Äôs advice</a> that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The effective executive therefore knows that he has to consoidate his discretionary time. He knows that he needs large chunks of time and that small driblets are no time at all. Even one quarter of the working day, if consolidated in large time units, is usually enough to get the important things done. But even three quarters of the working day are useless if they are only available as fifteen minutes here or half an hour there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tasks for this Focus Time are tagged <strong>focus</strong> in my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/">GTD</a>, which I prioritized for today‚Äôs work yesterday, so when I sit down with my coffee I can get right to work.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll sometimes use whitenoise or a single-song on repeat for hours during this Focus Time ‚Äî blocking my Focus Time each morning like this is one of the most important habits I have as a CEO.</p>
<p>A few hours in I have <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/meetings/daily-scrum">standup calls</a> on Zoom with my team, but these only last a few minutes, then I‚Äôm back to Focus Time.</p>
<p>Somewhere around noon or 1pm, it‚Äôs time to switch. I mix another bottle of Huel to drink while walking to my next work-spot, usually our office. The rest of my day is then spent quickly context-switching between small tasks, or in meetings.</p>
<p>Oh, and I‚Äôm tracking what I do on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://toggl.com/">Toggl</a>, since arriving at the morning cafe. I‚Äôm also setting up that backpack workstation, everywhere I go.</p>
<p>By late afternoon I‚Äôve (hopefully) accomplished everything I prioritized in GTD for today, and it‚Äôs time for my GTD Review (which I do daily).</p>
<p>I inbox-zero my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/">Omnifocus inbox</a>, email inbox, and my Evernote <em>‚ÄòThinking Out Loud‚Äô</em> note which by now has filled up with the day‚Äôs stream-of-conciousness thoughts. Then, I read (or re-read) something useful for my learning.</p>
<p>I breifly review and edit every task in my Omnifocus, and double-check that I‚Äôve correctly logged my Toggl today which lets me reflect on the day‚Äôs work accomplished.</p>
<p>Finally, I prioritize my work in GTD for the following day.</p>
<p>If it‚Äôs Friday I‚Äôll do a more thorough review, which includes things like breaking down <strong>macro</strong>-tagged tasks in GTD to next-actions, if I‚Äôll try to complete those macro tasks in the following week.</p>
<p>When that‚Äôs all done I grab my markdown editor to write a Management Journal for the day where I reflect on the <strong>We</strong>, the <strong>It</strong>, and the <strong>I</strong>.</p>
<p>With that all done, now my work day‚Äôs over.</p>
<p>So it‚Äôs time for <strong>Think Time</strong>, which can mean a long walk, or sitting alone in a park, to just think or to (re)listen to a Stoic audiobook.</p>
<p><em>There‚Äôs then a variable few evening-hours here where I‚Äôll usually either do something with my wife, or see some of my friends.</em></p>
<p><img src="/images/My-Habits/sleep.jpg" alt="Sleep" title="Sleep"></p>
<p>When I‚Äôm home for the night I‚Äôll watch something on my computer if it‚Äôs early, then switch to reading as it gets later.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll take my creatine, mix my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://sethroberts.net/2013/11/05/honey-at-bedtime-improves-sleep/">apple cider vinegar and honey</a>, have a shower, get my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.tuck.com/magnesium-and-sleep/">magnesium oil</a>, then get to bed with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cozyphones.com/products/lycra-headband-headphones">cozyphones</a>, a sleep mask, and a good audiobook.</p>

<p>It took me some time to develop these habits, however I‚Äôve been adhering to most of them for quite awhile now, and my life‚Äôs much the better for it.</p>
<p>I hope a thing or two above may be useful for you as well, and would love to know how you think I could make my own habits better.</p>
<div id="disqus_thread"></div></div></article><article><div class="post_title"><h1><a href="/Three-Years-of-Travel/">Three Years of Travel</a></h1><p class="date">Saturday, August 15th 2015</p><ul class="tags"><li><a href="/tags/Travel/">Travel</a></li></ul></div><div class="post_content"><p>In 2011 I went to a dinner at a friend‚Äôs - one of my old high school teachers - and at some point in the conversation he asked <em>‚ÄúHow‚Äôs your job?‚Äù</em> I had a great job, but I really wasn‚Äôt happy being in Halifax anymore. I remember answering that <em>‚Äúmy job‚Äôs awesome, there‚Äôs no other job I can imagine that could be better‚Ä¶but god, I really just want to work on my own stuff. And I wish I could travel.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>It was a feeling that had been building up for a long time.</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<p>The next morning my boss fired me and I remember a feeling of so much freedom and releif that I didn‚Äôt even ask why. I just kind of lit up inside and said ‚Äúok‚Äù. He eventually did tell me why, it was because I was so focused on my own stuff and not the company‚Äôs stuff, but while he was explaining that my mind was already racing with thoughts of <em>‚ÄúI can do anything now.‚Äù</em> Before this I‚Äôd been struggling because I knew I wanted something else, but at this point in my life my <em>do what you‚Äôre passionate about</em> muscle was still in development and I needed this push.</p>
<p>Now I had to choose what to do next. I‚Äôd built a video aggregator which was getting a few hundred thousand views per month - a few friends wanted to invest and some others in the local community were starting to pay attention to me for the first time, mostly due to the reputation of the company I had been working in. The thing is, the only person who didn‚Äôt seem to think it was a real business was me. I had built it to learn how to code something other than a basic WordPress theme, and I‚Äôd achieved that goal while building something cool that I used myself, but I didn‚Äôt really want to dedicate years of my life to this thing.</p>
<p>About a week later I did what my gut told me to - forget the video aggregator. I was going to sell everything I owned in Canada, put my life into a duffle bag, book a one-way ticket to Thailand and figure the rest out when I got there.</p>
<p>My old boss referred a freelance client to me and taught me a bit about his time freelancing. I decided that I‚Äôd wait a few weeks to see if the freelance work kept coming in steady, and when it did, I booked my one-way ticket.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Thailand"><a href="#Thailand" class="headerlink" title="Thailand"></a>Thailand</h3><p>Everyone was telling me to get a job - nobody really thought the whole one-way to Asia ticket was a good idea, but I didn‚Äôt really care. I‚Äôd just say <em>‚Äúno, I‚Äôm going to Thailand‚Äù</em> and ignore them.</p>
<p>A blog post had called Thailand the best place to start longterm travel, which is why I was headed there - other than that blog post I didn‚Äôt know much about it. I booked a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://lubd.com/silom/">hostel in Bangkok</a> and a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.bankongrao.com/">hotel in Chiang Mai</a>, to try both hostels and hotels since I didn‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd like staying in a hostel. Bangkok was the place that I‚Äôd heard of so I flew there first for two weeks, and I‚Äôd read online that Thailand‚Äôs seedier tourists tend to steer clear of Chiang Mai so I decided to head there too for a week, taking a train between the two.</p>
<p><img src="/images/thailand.jpg" alt="Thai Temple"></p>
<p>I spent most of my time in Bangkok getting on the metro or into a water taxi, taking it as far away as I could, then getting out and trying to find my way back to my hostel on foot.</p>
<p>It was a lot of fun. I remember taking the water taxi to a random place and deciding <em>‚ÄúI‚Äôll get out here‚Äù</em> - I was getting weird looks from all the Thai people on the water taxi so I knew this was a strange place to get out. It was military barracks for miles - eventually I made it to something like a sparse city area, where I stumbled onto the last metro stop on the outskirts of Bangkok. I made some friends at the hostel, and I spent a lot of time doing freelance work, but my Bangkok experience was mainly about this type of walking around in random directions.</p>
<p>After taking the train to Chiang Mai, I settled into the hotel and started to do the same type of on-foot exploring, but this time with a direction in mind: going hiking, to the old city, or visiting the aquarium and zoo. I‚Äôd work in cafes, then walk for hours in a new direction.</p>
<p>Around the same time I was fired from my job I had quit a correspondence MBA program I‚Äôd been taking for about a year. The day that I quit I bought an e-Reader to undertake self-education as an alternative, and I spent a good part of my time in Chiang Mai reading and learning. This is a picture of a mountain where I‚Äôd hiked to spend the day reading.</p>

<h3 id="Singapore"><a href="#Singapore" class="headerlink" title="Singapore"></a>Singapore</h3><p>I‚Äôd planned both the Thailand and Singapore legs before leaving Canada - there was a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.techinasia.com/sua-infographic">tech conference going on in Singapore</a> so I thought it‚Äôd be a good way to make some friends. I‚Äôm still friends with the people I met there, I see some of them all the time, so the conference was time well spent.</p>
<p>I started hanging out with a guy named <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/haegwankim">Haegwan Kim</a> which was lucky for me because besides Haegwan being cool, he also had a lot of cool friends. One of his friends was a well-off Japanese banker who started showing us around Singapore. I guess due to Japanese culture he treated us anywhere we went (because he was older than us). We then started hanging out with another of Haegwan‚Äôs friends Loki, who at the time of writing I‚Äôve now seen in I think 4 countries since meeting in Singapore.</p>
<p>After a few days the conference was over, Haegwan was headed to the airport so I decided to share a cab and go with him. When I got to the airport I went to find an airport computer - I didn‚Äôt have a plane ticket to actually <em>go anywhere</em> yet, so I needed to figure out where I wanted to go.</p>
<p>Malaysia was close and I had an aunt there, so I booked a ticket leaving a few hours later.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Malaysia"><a href="#Malaysia" class="headerlink" title="Malaysia"></a>Malaysia</h3><p>Malaysia was interesting.</p>
<p>My aunt had moved to Malaysia about 10 years earlier and had been living in Kuala Lumpur ever since. I got her number from my parents, called her a day or two after arriving, then went out to meet her. I didn‚Äôt know it yet, but when she heard that I was in Malaysia <em>she‚Äôd had a plan for what I could do there.</em></p>
<p>She works at an international school in Kuala Lumpur making costumes for the theatre department. When I arrived, she‚Äôd taken a freelance job doing costumes for a play about the life of Napoleon Hill, and they were looking for actors.</p>
<p>She brought me to a rehearsal to meet the director, I think knowing that he‚Äôd try to recruit me. When the director heard my deep voice he decided almost immediately that he wanted me to play a U.S. senator, despite the reservations of some others due to me <em>literally</em> cowering in a corner for the whole rehearsal given how uncomfortable the whole situation made me.</p>
<p>When he asked if I‚Äôd join the cast I said I‚Äôd think about it, and I sat down in the corner watch the rehearsal. My first plan was to be as vague as possible for as long as possible about whether I‚Äôd do it, until they got tired of asking me. I found the idea terrifying - I‚Äôd always been very shy/socially-anxious and I couldn‚Äôt imagine anything that would make me more uncomfortable than joining the cast of a musical.</p>
<p>But then I realized that‚Äôs exactly the point. The fact that it was terrifying was a <em>good thing</em>. I didn‚Äôt <em>want</em> to be shy - I hated it - and this was the best opportunity I‚Äôd ever have to change that. I told him I‚Äôd do it.</p>
<p><img src="/images/nap-hill-2.jpg" alt="Napoleon Hill Musical"></p>
<p>We rehearsed daily for the next three months. Besides being some of the most extroverted people I‚Äôd ever met the rest of the cast were also some of the most <em>accepting</em> people I‚Äôd ever met, so I was never made to feel the odd one out despite that obviously being the case. I was actually surprised how much patience they had while I slowly struggled with the discomfort of what I was doing.</p>
<p><img src="/images/nap-hill-1.jpg" alt="Napoleon Hill the Musical"></p>
<p>I‚Äôd made great friends, and had a lot of fun - that in itself was worth it. But what I‚Äôd hoped to accomplish going in was an exercise in practiced discomfort to overcome whatever insecurities made me feel uncomfortable in these types of situations. You can hear Tim Ferriss talk about practiced discomfort below:</p>

<p><strong>It worked.</strong> I hadn‚Äôt gotten over things completely, but I was a changed person compared with three months prior, and I had laid the foundation on which I could continue to change that part of myself over my next few years of travel. My life would be a in a very different place right now if I‚Äôd told the director no after watching that first day of rehearsals, and practiced discomfort has been an important part of my life ever since.</p>
<p><img src="/images/nap-hill-3.jpg" alt="Napoleon Hill Musical Poster"></p>
<p>We had months of rehearsals, a flash mob at Kuala Lumpur‚Äôs biggest mall, and a few weeks of live shows at the end. It was one of the best experienced I‚Äôve ever had. And Malaysia also changed how I travel. I‚Äôd spent 3 months there, which felt like a good span of time, and over the next few years I‚Äôd spend at least a few months in each country I visited.</p>
<p>Oh, and I spent some time on the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perhentian_Islands">Perhentian Islands</a> with some of the cast, which was awesome, but the musical was the highlight of Malaysia so I‚Äôll stop the story there.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Cambodia"><a href="#Cambodia" class="headerlink" title="Cambodia"></a>Cambodia</h3><p>My aunt had always wanted to visit <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angkor_Wat">Angkor Wat in Cambodia</a> - but she‚Äôs the only one in our family living in Asia so she‚Äôd never had the chance. We decided we‚Äôd go together after the musical.</p>
<p><img src="/images/cambodia-1.jpg" alt="Angkor Wat"></p>
<p>Angkor Wat was <em>hot.</em> A heat wave hit during our visit. At first we thought this was a problem because we couldn‚Äôt survive outside too long (though we tried anyway), but at the end of our trip when the heat died down we realized that it had been the only thing keeping the crowds away. In our final days Angkor Wat filled with people, whereas until then we‚Äôd had the whole place to ourselves.</p>
<p><img src="/images/cambodia-2.jpg" alt="Angkor Wat"></p>
<p>After visiting Angkor Wat, my aunt headed back to Malaysia and I headed to Phnom Pehn to spend a few weeks catching up on freelance work in cafes; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.browncoffee.com.kh/">Brown Coffee</a> in Cambodia is still one of my favourite cafes in the world.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, after I‚Äôd spent the entire time in Phnom Pehn working, I had one day left. I took the day off to walk across the city, one side to the other. When I got to the other side of the city I wanted to keep going, so I kept walking into the villages on the outskirts of the city. There, standing on a dirt road surrounded by farmer‚Äôs fields, a monsoon rain started pouring on me.</p>
<p>I started walking back to the city in the rain to hide under overhanging roofs and ledges, zig zagging my way back between different shelters on my way into the city. I was hoping I could find a tuk tuk once I made it back. But, once I made it back into the denser part of the city the rain got even heavier. I was forced to hide under an overhanging roof in knee-deep water for a few hours, in a small street on the outskirts of the city. It was actually fantastic.</p>
<p>Kids were playing in water that was gushing from storm pipes, people were washing their clothes and playing with their children in the rain, and anyone not playing in the rain was hiding under an overhang beside me. I stayed there a few hours enjoying the experience and thinking about books I wanted to write when I‚Äôm old and retired.</p>

<p>Once the rain stopped I managed to find my way back to a place where I could get a tuk tuk - it turns out there were a few tuk tuks a few blocks away the whole time - and made my way back to my hostel to dry off. The next day I was headed for Japan.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Japan"><a href="#Japan" class="headerlink" title="Japan"></a>Japan</h3><p>Southeast Asia-living is pretty cheap so by this time I‚Äôd banked enough money to visit somewhere more expensive. I had always wanted to go to Japan so I had booked myself a ticket the same time I‚Äôd booked my Cambodia tickets.</p>
<p><img src="/images/surfing-jp.jpg" alt="Surfing in Japan"></p>
<p>I wanted to continue pushing my comfort zone in social situations, continue to practice discomfort, so when I arrived in Tokyo I signed up for Hip Hop class. But it turned out that this really didn‚Äôt make me feel uncomfortable anymore, so I had to move onto something else.</p>

<p>I got to do a lot of cool things in Japan, some friends took me surfing and I went back to my random-walking routine and I got to visit a friend from high school, but the real highlight came with a trip to Okinawa.</p>
<p><img src="/images/okinawa.jpg" alt="Okinawa"></p>
<p>Okinawa‚Äôs got two groups of islands. There‚Äôs the islands around <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naha">Naha</a>, that‚Äôs where Mr. Miyagi‚Äôs from and I call it <em>Japanese Hawaii</em> since it‚Äôs pretty touristy. Then there‚Äôs the group of islands around <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishigaki,_Okinawa">Ishigaki</a> - it‚Äôs far less touristy - you can think of it as a collection of tropical Japanese islands which each have a tiny Japanese town on them, surrounded by untouched coral reefs.</p>
<p><img src="/images/okinawa-map.png" alt="Okinawa Map"></p>
<p>This was a very, very good trip. I think the main highlight was staying in a guest house owned by a guy named Yoshi - everyone staying there had met each other, and Yoshi‚Äôs father came to visit the island one night bringing with him a traditional Japanese instrument to play for us. Eventually Yoshi decided to take us all out in the boat to swim the reef under moonlight. Okinawa was a chain of great experiences just like this.</p>
<p><img src="/images/okinawa-2.jpg" alt="Okinawa"></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Korea"><a href="#Korea" class="headerlink" title="Korea"></a>Korea</h3><p>After Japan I headed to Korea, with no plan what to do when I got there.</p>
<p>I rented a place near Seoul station and settled in for a 3 month stay. A few weeks in I‚Äôd gotten over the initial excitement of how good the wifi and the cafes were, so I decided to find something to do. Summer intake for Korean Language programs was happening, so I figured why not learn Korean. I became a student of Korean language at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.skku.edu/eng_home/index.jsp">Sungkyunkwan University</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/korea.jpg" alt="Korea Class"></p>
<p>I‚Äôd always been interested in languages - I‚Äôd learned everything from French to Icelandic while in high school - so I knew I‚Äôd enjoy the class. But I was really just hoping to make some friends, which is exactly what happened. The school paired us up with local Korean students studying English, and I spent the next few months exploring Korea with these friends. It was pretty awesome how much effort they put into showing us the country.</p>
<p><img src="/images/korea-2.jpg" alt="Korea"></p>
<p><img src="/images/korea-3.jpg" alt="Korea"></p>
<p>After the program finished I spent a few weeks in cafes catching up on freelance work and hanging out with some friends. I took a trip to Busan, where I would walk as far as possible in a random direction like I‚Äôd done in Thailand. I‚Äôve been back to Korea for 1-2 day trips here and there since, but I really want to spend more time in Korea someday.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Taiwan"><a href="#Taiwan" class="headerlink" title="Taiwan"></a>Taiwan</h3><p>I‚Äôd gone to Korea because it was the closest flight form Japan, so I followed the pattern and headed to Taiwan next. I‚Äôd had a Taiwanese friend Ray in my Korean class, so I figured I‚Äôd have a friend there as well. Within a few days in Taiwan I met Reynold, then Ian, then Gaetan and we spent a lot of time together over the next few months in Taiwan.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm writing this blog post so that I don‚Äôt forget about the period of my life I spent traveling - but the one thing I know I won‚Äôt forget is why I decided to live in Taiwan, so I‚Äôm going to skip putting that in here. That‚Äôs its own story. I spent 3 months in Taiwan before heading to Hong Kong.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Hong-Kong-amp-Macau"><a href="#Hong-Kong-amp-Macau" class="headerlink" title="Hong Kong &amp; Macau"></a>Hong Kong &amp; Macau</h3><p>After Taiwan I headed to Hong Kong. I was mostly catching up on work again while here, and hanging out with some friends I‚Äôd met, but the highlight of Hong Kong was actually the trips to Macau.</p>

<p>I loved Macau. I went there with my friends for a night (Ian from Taiwan had come over, and introduced Ben). After that I went back to Macau for a day by myself, to explore the city on foot. Up to this point I‚Äôd hated taking pictures any time I traveled, but I pulled out my iPhone to take some quick videos as I walked around that day and a few months later edited them together in the video above.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="The-Philippines"><a href="#The-Philippines" class="headerlink" title="The Philippines"></a>The Philippines</h3><p>I only ended up staying in Hong Kong / Macau about a month. I cut it short to take a trip to the Philippines with Anna. I‚Äôd met her while living in Taiwan a few months before, and when she came to the Philippines she had a plan to bring me back to Taiwan with her afterwards. The entire time I‚Äôd been in Hong Kong I‚Äôd been thinking the exact same thing, so that wasn‚Äôt very hard for her to do. She‚Äôs been my girlfriend since the trip, and now (a few years later) I‚Äôm sitting in Taiwan beside her as I write this, so I guess her plan worked.</p>
<p>We flew to Clark (a small city near Manila with cheap flights) with the intention of going to Boracay. I asked the taxi driver <em>‚Äúhow far to Boracay?‚Äù</em> and he answered <em>‚Äúwhat? you mean by plane?‚Äù</em> Apparently Boracay was in a completely different part of the Philippines. I hadn‚Äôt even checked a map before we‚Äôd flown there, so with Boracay on the other side of the country we needed a new plan.</p>
<p><img src="/images/anna-philippines.jpg" alt="Anna in Philippines"></p>
<p>We went to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagaytay">Tagaytay</a> where we rode horses up the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taal_Volcano">Taal Volcano</a> where that picture above was taken, explored Manila and headed to Olongapo to see Subic beach, and rode tuk tuks through the mountains.</p>
<p>After Anna left, I stayed in Manila a few weeks while I renewed my passport at the Canadian embassy, working out of cafes and walking around the city. Once I got my passport, I headed back to Taiwan with Anna.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Nepal"><a href="#Nepal" class="headerlink" title="Nepal"></a>Nepal</h3><p>I was having a beer with a friend (Ian), talking about how I couldn‚Äôt decide where to travel next and he said <em>‚Äúmy friends went to Nepal in high school, they liked it.‚Äù</em> I thought that sounded like a good idea.</p>
<p>I flew into Kathmandu the next week and after a few days walking the city headed into the mountains, to a town in the Kathmandu Valley called Nagarkot which <a href="http://nickbudden.com/Nagarkot-Nepal/">I wrote about here</a>. After some time there I checked where the next largest city was: it was <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokhara">Pokhara</a>, so I got on a bus and headed there. After arriving and Googling ‚Äúwhat to do in Pokhara‚Äù I stumbled onto something called the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.backpacker.com/trips/international/the-perfect-circle-hiking-the-annapurna-circuit/#bp=0/img1">Annapura Circuit</a>. It‚Äôs a trekking route, generally considered one of the best - if not <em>the</em> best - treks in the world.</p>
<p><strong>It sounded great.</strong> I bought a rain coat, packed my backpack, and got ready to head for the Himalayas.</p>
<p>The morning I was leaving my hotel for the trek I saw someone in my hotel (Nadith) reading a brochure for the Annapurna Circuit over breakfast. I asked if he was going to do the trek and he said yes, he was planning to leave a few days later but when he learned that I was headed there now he went upstairs, grabbed his gear, and we headed out on the trek together.</p>
<p><img src="/images/annapurna.jpg" alt="Annapurna"></p>
<p>Depending on your route the Annapurna circuit is a roughly 3-week trek through the Himalayas. It passes by some of the world‚Äôs tallest mountains, and directly through some of the world‚Äôs highest passes. It‚Äôs really impossible to describe here in a blog post - you‚Äôll have to go someday.</p>

<p>Nadith and I trekked together for quite awhile, but about half-way through he unfortunately hurt his foot and had to trek his way out to the roads where he could get a ride back to the city.</p>
<p><img src="/images/annapurna-2.jpg" alt="Annapurna"></p>
<p>After Nadith left I set out on my own. Typically the Annapurna Circuit can be a bit crowded due to its popularity, but this was the very end of the rainy season and the tourists hadn‚Äôt arrived yet; there were only a few others doing the trek. I‚Äôd head out each day alone (which I love), but because everyone was on roughly the same pace I‚Äôd end up meeting up with the same trekkers each evening in the next town. We soon had a group of friends. It was pretty awesome to trek alone through the day, then meet up with your friends each night.</p>
<iframe frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.facebook.com/video/embed?video_id=10153167329145720" width="550"></iframe>

<p><code>^ click photo to play video</code></p>
<p>I didn‚Äôt trek the whole way alone. Once we reached the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorong_La">Thorong La pass</a> we all decided to go over together as a group of about 20 trekkers - this pass is where <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Nepal_snowstorm_disaster">quite a few hikers died in 2014</a>.</p>
<p>Once over the pass, the town on the other side had hot running water and beer. This was a bit of a shock because the day before we had been so deep in the mountains that there was no electricity save for a few solar panels. I then spent the next few days trekking with a group of Germans studying in Thailand (hopefully I can visit them in Germany someday), then again set out on my own when they settled down for a rest in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kagbeni,_Mustang">Kagbeni</a>.</p>
<p>But as I trekked, I kept running into people I‚Äôd met along the way each evening, and I‚Äôd even end up meeting up with the German group back in Pokhara after the trek.</p>
<p><img src="/images/annapurna-3.jpg" alt="Annapurna"></p>
<p>The Annapurna Circuit is too diverse to fit into a blog post. You‚Äôll trek through jungles, snowcapped Himalayas, Buddhist templates, deserted plains neighbouring Tibet, mountain-top lakes and waterfalls, and far more than I can list. I will probably do it again someday.</p>

<p>Typically in Taiwan I‚Äôd have a weekend trip or two, but I mostly stayed in the city. A big exception happened between Nepal and Sri Lanka trips where I took a bike down Taiwan‚Äôs west coast for a few weeks. <a href="http://nickbudden.com/Biking-Around-Taiwan-Taipei-to-Kaoshiung/">I‚Äôve got that here</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Sri-Lanka"><a href="#Sri-Lanka" class="headerlink" title="Sri Lanka"></a>Sri Lanka</h3><p>I went to Sri Lanka for a few months to learn to surf, and booked myself into a beach-side hotel on Sri Lanka‚Äôs southern coast. I‚Äôd surf a few hours each morning, then work on my laptop in the evenings, hoping to finish up all of my work so that I could take a few weeks off.</p>

<p>The waves were a bit rough, and when it finally came time to take a few weeks off work I decided I needed a change of plan. Someone in my hotel had rented a motorcycle - it seemed like a good idea, so I rented a scooter and planned to drive it right around the whole island of Sri Lanka.</p>
<p><em>As a sidenote when I got to where the scooter rental was I realized that that was where the beginner waves were for surfing - the rough waves were because I was in the wrong place. So someday I plan to go back to these beginner waves and learn to surf.</em></p>
<p>Anyway - I jumped on the scooter and started driving off into the depths of Sri Lanka. I didn‚Äôt have a map or a data plan on my phone, and very few people outside the tourist areas spoke English, which made everything a lot more fun.</p>

<p>Sri Lanka‚Äôs a pretty amazing place. It‚Äôs got amazing beaches, huge deserts, beautiful mountains‚Ä¶and what seems to be what most people imagine as African wildlife. I first headed to Sri Lanka‚Äôs South-East Coast where I checked into a hotel in the middle of a rice field (shown in the video above), then headed out on Safari to see elephants, leopards, and more of the local wildlife.</p>
<iframe frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.facebook.com/video/embed?video_id=10154015404290720" width="550"></iframe>

<p><code>^ click photo to play video</code></p>
<p>After the safari I got back on the scooter and headed north into the mountains. I drove through <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandy">Kandy</a> where I almost got arrested for not having a license, into <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuwara_Eliya">Nuwara Elia</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/sri-lanka/the-hill-country/ella">Ella</a> through mountains covered in tea fields, then back down into the plains to head towards <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigiriya">Sigiriya</a>.</p>
<p>I remember getting caught in a more than a few downpours and hiding out in the biggest trees I could find; I remember following signs for a local temple down a steep dirt road and almost not being able to make it back up the slope on the way out, getting stuck deep in the Sri Lankan forrest as a result; I remember winding roads through tea mountains, and getting lost on roads so remote that kids would get so excited to see a foreigner they‚Äôd chase you down the street to wave.</p>

<p>When I set out I had planned to circle the whole island, but I had been almost two weeks on the road to make it to Sigiriya, so it was time to turn around. I took the route through the capital Colombo on my way back south, relaxed a few more days on the south coast, then I took a train back into Colombo before heading back to Taiwan.</p>

<h3 id="What-I‚Äôm-Doing-Now"><a href="#What-I‚Äôm-Doing-Now" class="headerlink" title="What I‚Äôm Doing Now"></a>What I‚Äôm Doing Now</h3><p>I‚Äôm not done traveling - since going to Sri Lanka I‚Äôve visited India a few times, I‚Äôve been back to Japan/Thailand/Malaysia a few times, spent a few weeks in a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changzhou">Changzhou, China</a>, I hop back and forth with San Francisco, I took a train coast-to-coast in Canada, and just recently got back from my first trip to Shenzhen. But I‚Äôm in a different phase of my life now. My Sri Lanka trip was over a year ago and my life‚Äôs focus has shifted from full-time travel to building our business. For this past year I‚Äôve been wanting to document this phase of my life so that I can look back on this years from now. I‚Äôve finally been able to do that.</p>
<div id="disqus_thread"></div></div></article><article><div class="post_title"><h1><a href="/My-Blog-is-Back/">My Blog is Back</a></h1><p class="date">Monday, August 10th 2015</p><ul class="tags"><li><a href="/tags/Startups/">Startups</a></li></ul></div><div class="post_content"><p>Last year was hard for money. The whole year was tough, but particularly hard was the last time I was raising cash for our startup Vectr in San Francisco. At that point we had two angel investors, but that money was just about gone and we were still primarily bootstrapping the company; I was in SF to raise VC money to keep us going.</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<p>At the time I had applied for as many credit cards as possible (I know because they stopped giving them to me, otherwise I‚Äôd have gotten more). Every one of the cards had been completely maxed out, and collection agencies were calling my parents in Canada on a near daily basis. Canada‚Äôs tax authority was pissed because I‚Äôd skipped paying my taxes that year to save money, knowing that I could get away with delaying it to later (I‚Äôm paying monthly installments on it now). My parents had borrowed money from the bank to lend me, and my girlfriend was working a second job (that she hated) to support me - she‚Äôd lent me most of her savings.</p>
<p>I was Googling the price of one-person tents and 24hr restaurants where I might sleep, until a friend named Theo offered to let me stay at his place. I think he probably thought I was kidding when I said I was about to be homeless before he invited me to stay with him, but I wasn‚Äôt. This is all a really long winded way of saying I <em>really</em> had no money, I could no longer afford the few dollars a month to host this blog, so I shut it down.</p>
<p>This, however, is a victory post - all that depressing stuff up top is just to set the scene. We‚Äôve raised a proper, real round of funding for our company. We‚Äôve got an amazing team of five developers including the founders, we‚Äôre nearing an early launch of Vectr, and as far as money‚Äôs concerned we‚Äôve got enough salary that homelessness is no longer a real possibility. Every month I put money on my credit cards, send some to my parents, and give some to my girlfriend, slowly working my way out of debt.</p>
<p>Being that broke was embarassing. This year‚Äôs turned around - I finally got around to getting this blog back up and it feels symbolic. I can afford my blog again. <strong>This year‚Äôs better.</strong></p>
